## Background
As our world progresses technologically, the health of our planet degrades day by day. Our group's aim was to analyze the trends seen today and model how our world could look in the future using machine learning.

## Topics
We explored several different phenomena and questions for our models to answer.

### Global Temperatures
_Is the Earth getting warmer?_
models

### Ocean Impacts
_How have the world's oceans been affected?_
models

### Weather Impacts
_How have weather and natural disasters responded to climate change? Should we expect more extreme weather systems?_
models

### Public Sentiment
_How does the public feel about climate change? Can we replicate online opinions with deep learning?_

In the U.S., the existence of climate change and the role of CO2 emissions have become a highly partisan topic. The U.S. ranked in the lower-half of percent of respondents who consider climate change to be a "major threat", and had the fourth-highest percentage of respondents stating that climate change is "not a threat".

### Awareness
_What parts of our behavior could we change? What is the cost/effectiveness of renewable energy? And how are we directly impacting the CO2 concentration levels?_
models

We trained our models to predict and validate indicators of the effects of climate change to answer the following questions:

---


How have the worlds oceans been affected?

This is consistent with rising global temperatures, both atmospheric and oceanic. This also directly contributes to rising sea levels, which in turn leads to flooding and higher likelihood of hurricane formation.


Should we expect more extreme weather systems?

What parts of our behavior could we change?

Opportunities to slow down the consumption of farmed animals which also would decrease the rate in which land is changed for housing livestock.


What is the cost/reward of renewable energy?

How are we directly impacting the CO2 concentration levels?

Changing landscape for agricultural purposes often leads to an unstable phosphate level in surrounding waterways. Land use change & animal waste accounts for 83% of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.
